about
=====

- When using Cordova 3.+ you can fetch the plugin from the Cordova plugin registry with: `cordova plugin add com.appsee.plugin`.
- This repository was made so a third party service such as [Appgyver Steroids](http://www.appgyver.com/steroids/) can   use the plugin. (Steroids needs a repo for the plugin in order to use it.)
